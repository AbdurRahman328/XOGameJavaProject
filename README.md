# XO Game Java Project
XO Game Project in java programming language

The XO game, commonly known as "Tic-Tac-Toe," which is a classic paper-and-pencil or digital game played on a 3x3 grid. 
The two players, traditionally represented by 'X' and 'O', take turns marking spaces in the grid.
This was implemented using simple java programming language.
